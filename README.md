Certainly! Here's a home test that covers Vue.js (Vue 2), Vuex, Mapbox GL, Sass, CSS, and includes an algorithmic task of easy to mid-level difficulty. 

### Frontend Developer Home Test

#### Task 1: Vue.js & Vuex

Create a simple Vue.js application that fetches data from an API and displays it in a list. Use Vuex for state management.

1. Set up a Vue.js project.
2. Create a Vuex store with a module to manage the application state.
3. Fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) using Vuex actions.
4. Display the fetched data in a component as a list.

#### Task 2: Mapbox GL

Integrate Mapbox GL into your Vue.js application.

1. Get a free Mapbox API key.
2. Display a Mapbox map in a separate component.
3. Add a marker to the map at a specific location.

#### Task 3: Sass & CSS

Use Sass to style your Vue.js components.

1. Create a reusable button component with different styles (primary, secondary, etc.).
2. Implement responsive design for your application.

#### Task 4: Algorithm

Implement a function in JavaScript that checks if a given word is a palindrome.

```javascript
function isPalindrome(word) {
  // Your code here
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isPalindrome("level")); // Should return true
console.log(isPalindrome("hello")); // Should return false
```

#### Submission Instructions:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a branch with your name.
3. Complete the tasks in your branch.
4. Commit your changes and push to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request from your branch to the master branch.

#### Additional Notes:

- Your code should be clean, well-organized, and follow best practices.
- Provide comments where necessary to explain your thought process.
- Include a README.md file explaining how to run your application and any additional notes.

Feel free to adjust the difficulty or add more specific requirements based on your team's needs.
